### ✅ **Completed Features:**

1. **Enhanced Modal App** (`modal/enhanced_modal_app.py`)
   - Cost tracking with budget limits ($2.0 test, configurable)
   - Checkpoint recovery with automatic resume
   - Dynamic batch size optimization
   - Model collapse detection and alerting
   - Real-time monitoring integration

2. **Advanced Training Logger** (`utils/training_logger.py`)
   - Generation quality sampling
   - Token-level statistics analysis
   - Loss breakdown monitoring
   - Gradient health tracking
   - Answer length distribution analysis

3. **Enhanced Training Scripts**
   - `train.py` - Updated with comprehensive logging
   - `train_custom.py` - Enhanced monitoring integration
   - Both scripts now include model collapse detection

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - `modal/test_enhanced_modal.py` - Feature validation script
   - All core features tested and working

### 🌟 **Key Capabilities:**

- **Resilience**: Checkpoint recovery, resumable training
- **Monitoring**: Model collapse detection, comprehensive logging
- **Optimization**: Auto batch sizing, memory management
- **Cloud Ready**: Runs independently after terminal disconnect

### 🎯 **Successfully Running:**

Modal App ID: `ap-oKSuB3eCHX9eAu3qt10cfw`
- GPU: NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB
- Budget: $2.0 (test mode)
- Dataset: Mixed COCO+VQAv2 (100 samples)
- Status: Running independently in cloud

### 📊 **Usage:**

```bash
python -m modal run modal/enhanced_modal_app.py::main \
  --test-run \
  --dataset-limit=1000 \
  --max-training-steps=500 \
  --budget-limit=5.0 \
  --auto-batch-size
```

### 🔧 **Repository Status:**

- Local implementation: ✅ Complete
- GitHub push: ❌ Fork restrictions prevent upload
- Patch file: ✅ Available (`enhanced-modal-features.patch`)
- Modal cloud: ✅ Running successfully

### 📋 **Next Steps:**

All major features are implemented and working. The only remaining optional task is creating configuration presets for different use cases (marked as low priority).
